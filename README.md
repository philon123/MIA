MIA - Magnetic Image Analyzer

An image analyzer that uses a variation of the floodfill algorithm to analyze scans of Co/Pt thin films. When not completely magnetized, these films show interesting patterns of magnetic domains, as you can see in the example image provided. The algorithm counts differently colored domains, counts pixels and outputs data in various formats. 

This was a collaboration with researchers at the Brigham Young University in Utah. The finished paper can be seen here:
